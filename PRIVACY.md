Eventy processes webpage or selected text only when you use the “Scan” action. The text is sent to our Cloudflare proxy and to OpenRouter to extract event details, then we open a prefilled Google Calendar page. We don’t collect, store, or sell personal information. No third‑party tracking is embedded. Data is transmitted over HTTPS and used only to fulfill the requested feature. Contact: eventy.sup@gmail.com.
